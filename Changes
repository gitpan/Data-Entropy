version 0.001; 2006-08-03

  * new function rand_flt() to generate a random floating point value
    in a floating point way

  * use ->as_number instead of ->as_int for BigRat->BigInt conversion,
    because ->as_int is faulty before Math::BigRat version 0.14 but
    ->as_number is available in much earlier versions (the version
    specified in Makefile.PL was one where ->as_int was faulty)

  * use standard interval notation in the Data::Entropy::Algorithms
    documentation

  * use "=> 0" instead of "=> undef" in unversioned dependencies in
    Makefile.PL

  * don't include underscore in string version of module version numbers
    in Makefile.PL

  * remove a redundant BigRat->BigInt conversion

version 0.000; 2006-07-19

  * initial released version
